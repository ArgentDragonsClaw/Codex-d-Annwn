# Prelude

The following hypothesis makes use of various knowledge collected in research conducted both by myself, and that conducted by my father, Ifan d'Anwwn. As such, there may be some concepts that need additional explanation. As specific concepts come to light as needing such elucidation, appendixes may be added to this hypothesis.

# Background

The core of this hypothesis stems from the **Axiomatic Hypothesis**:
> All types of magic are equivalent at their core, derived from a base magic.

Of course, the standard understanding of Magic divides it into two categories: *arcane* and *divine*. However, for my purposes, these divisions are incomplete. As such, I propose the following divisions:
- *arcane*: The magic born of willpower
- *bardic*: The magic inherent in words and communication
- *divine*: The magic born of faith
- *druidic*: The magic suffused within the natural world
- *wild*: The magic of chaos

The widly known set of eight schools will suffice.


# Hypothesis

The hypothesis, henceforth referred to as the **Chorus Hypothesis**, is as follows:
> All types of magic are modulations of the base magic. 

An obvious corellary:
> It is impossible to utilize the base magic without modulation.

To begin examining the CH, consider music[^1]. When an instrument plays different notes, we still consider those notes to be 'part' of the music, defining them by their pitch. However, as shown by certain instruments, it is possible to slide between these notes, so they can also be considered a single thing.


It is my belief that magic operates under a similar concept. Take the previously defined divisions as individual notes, and the base magic as the underlying essence. This is why overlap exists between different divisions, such as spells like [*earth tremor*](https://thebombzen.com/grimoire/spells/earth-tremor). 

What, then, of the schools of magic? If we consider the divisions as notes, the schools become 'what' one plays, namely the instruments. Different schools of magic exist, using the same 'notes' to produce different effects, an evocation spell using arcane magic will produce different effects than an illusion spell using the same arcane magic.

# Moving Forward

Currently, this hypothesis is untested, but I believe it may hold merit based on my own experiments into replication of divine magic through arcane magic. My intent is to continue exploration into the modulation of magic, to determine if the CH is capable of holding water.
I have speculation regarding methods of doing so, but will not discuss them here.
