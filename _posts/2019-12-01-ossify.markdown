**1st-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, M (a pinch of bone dust)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Organic materials you touch rapidly ossify, up to half a cubic foot of material. If used on an unwilling target, the target must make a Constitution saving throw.  A target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and on a failed saving throw succumbs to partial ossification.

This spell does not affect inorganic targets, such as stone or metal, but may conduct along them to organic material within an inch.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
