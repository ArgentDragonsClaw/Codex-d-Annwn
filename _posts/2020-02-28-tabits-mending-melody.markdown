**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 ft

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 minute

You imbue your voice with healing energies as you sing a simple melody. On your turn, all allied creatures that can hear you heal 4 hp. Creatures cannot benefit from this healing while Deafened, and this healing has no effect on constructs or undead.

As a bonus action on your turn, you may end your melody early with a flourish, removing the Charmed and Frightened statuses from allied creatures that can hear you.
