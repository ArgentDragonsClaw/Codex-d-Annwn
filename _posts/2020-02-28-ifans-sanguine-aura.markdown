**2nd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

You are surrounded by a 10 foot aura of fine red mist as you cast this spell. On your turn, every hostile creature within the mist loses 3 hit points, healing you for 3 hp. In the presence of blood (for example, [*grave warden's mantle*](https://argentdragonsclaw.github.io/Codex-d-Annwn/spells/grave-wardens-mantle)) the damage and healing doubles.
