You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and deal 1d4 piercing damage as you draw blood. The creature's blood becomes a magical mantle surrounding them.
The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Constitution modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
