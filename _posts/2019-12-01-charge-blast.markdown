**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 ft

**Components**:  V, S, M ( A small wooden ring )

**Duration**: Instantaneous (Concentration)

A crackling orb of force manifests in your open hand. On your turn, you may throw the orb to a point within range. If you lose concentration for any reason, you automatically throw the orb to a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

For every round you maintain concentration on *charge blast*, increase the damage by 1d6, to a maximum of 4d6.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
