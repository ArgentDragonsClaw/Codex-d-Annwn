**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

You create a meal (with optional drink) and the necessary glasses, plates, and silverware to eat it. All objects created by this spell are only able to interact with the caster, and simply pass through other creatures like air. The food and drink have actual nutritional value, but become inedible after one hour, and then vanish back into the void.

The specific meals and drinks are limited only to the caster's knowledge of their existence.
