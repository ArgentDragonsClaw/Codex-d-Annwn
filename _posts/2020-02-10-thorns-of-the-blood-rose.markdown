**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 ft

**Components**: V, S, C (a dried rose seed)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Thick black stems covered in thorns sprout from the ground, wrapping around up to three creatures within range, which can be no more than 10ft from one another. While covered in thorns, a creature takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage from all attacks as the thorns dig deeper. If a creature dies while covered in thorns, a bright crimson Blood Rose sprouts from their corpse, which remains after the spell ends.

As an action, a creature affected by the thorns may make a Strength check against your spellcasting DC to break free. If the creature takes fire damage, the thorns burn to ash after dealing damage.
