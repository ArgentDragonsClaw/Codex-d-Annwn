**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 10 ft

**Components**:  V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse.

You infuse the creature with your will, permanently binding it to yourself. The creature's Int, Wis, Cha, and proficiency modifiers match yours at the time of casting. The creature is visually distinct from non-bound undead, with energy modeled after your motifs holding it together. (As an example, Morganna's bound servants are held together by rose vines of crackling electricity, flowers blooming from the creature's eyes)

Immediately after casting this spell, your HP drops to 0, but you remain conscious. 

The creature is intelligent and can act on its own; however, you may issue mental orders to the creature if it is within 60 feet of you as a bonus action, and it will prioritize these orders. If you die, the creature remains alive and will act on any orders it had remaining before becoming free. Bound creatures are highly devoted, and may continue to act in the benefit of their deceased master.

Casting this spell on a creature you animated with this spell will reset its Int, Wis, Cha, and proficiency modifiers. You may have at most one bound creature created with this spell.
