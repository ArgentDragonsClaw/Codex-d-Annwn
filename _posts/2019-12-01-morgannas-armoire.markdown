**2nd-level conjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M ( A scrap of silk )

**Duration**: 1 hour

You create an ornate mahogany door that, when opened, leads to an extradimensional space filled with clothing. The clothing contained within the *armoire* can be found in every style known to the creatures inside, and will fit any creature that puts them on within the *armoire*. The clothes do not contain any accessories of value, such as rings or necklaces, but may contain faux-copies such as a wooden ring painted gold. A creature may have up to two outfits selected from the *armoire* at a time, and must return one before choosing another. The clothes themselves are nonmagical other than their creation, and subject to wear and tear as any mundane material. 

If an outfit is ruined beyond repair or lost, it disappates into mist, and the creature is no longer considered to have that outfit. Attempting to sell or otherwise make money off the clothes also causes them to disappate into mist.
