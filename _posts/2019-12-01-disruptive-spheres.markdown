**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 ft

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of fulgurite)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create three slightly shimmering spheres of energy. Make a ranged spell attack for each sphere against a creature in range. On a hit, a sphere deals 1d4 force damage. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, the concentration save is against DC 15.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more sphere and the DC increases by 1 for each slot level above 1st.
